 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .B dmidecode
 is a tool for dumping a computer's \s-1DMI\s0 (some say \s-1SMBIOS\s0) table
-contents in a human-readable format. This table contains a description of the
+contents in a human\-readable format. This table contains a description of the
 system's hardware components, as well as other useful pieces of information
 such as serial numbers and \s-1BIOS\s0 revision. Thanks to this table, you can
 retrieve this information without having to probe for the actual hardware.
